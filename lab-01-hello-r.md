## Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

It has 13 rows and 6 columns. The variables included are “dataset”,
“mean_x”, “mean_y”, std_dev_x”, “std_dev_y”, and “corr_x\_y”.

### Exercise 2

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

### Exercise 3

Even though this plot of the star dataset looks very different than the
code of the dino dataset…

``` r
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-star-1.png)<!-- -->

…the correlation coefficients between x and y for both datasets are the
same!

``` r
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0630

### Exercise 4

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but
they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them
appropriately.

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed.

To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the
letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.
